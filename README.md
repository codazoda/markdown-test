# Markdown Test

This is a markdown test of Github. I'm wondering if I can just create a directory of markdown files, turn on Github hosting, and have it automatically convert those to HTML and host them (no Jekyl or anything else needed).

I've got a few questions.

1) Will md files be converted to HTML automatically?
2) Will gh serve readme.md, README.md, and index.md?
3) What order will gh serve those files?
4) How long does it take for gh-pages to generate?

That's about it. I think I already know how directories will work, etc.

Here are some answers about my questions above.

## Automatic HTML

Yes, Github automatically converts markdown files to HTML now. At the top of the page it puts a "title" with the name of the repo (in the same case). You can probably change this with yaml files or something, but that works for now. That title links back to your home page.

## Index Files

The following files will work as index filenames.

- index.md
- readme.md
- README.md
