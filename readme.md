# Markdown Test

This is a markdown test of Github. I'm wondering if I can just create a directory of markdown files, turn on Github hosting, and have it automatically convert those to HTML and host them (no Jekyl or anything else needed).

I've got a few questions.

    1) Will md files be converted to HTML automatically?
    2) Will gh serve readme.md, README.md, and index.md?
    3) What order will gh serve those files?

That's about it. I think I already know how directories will work, etc.
